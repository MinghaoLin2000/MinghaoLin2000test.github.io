I am an independent security researcher now. I also am a member of [Terminal OS Architecture & Security Team (TOAST) ](https://toast-research.github.io/). Previously, I was a research assistant at Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Wenbo Shen](https://wenboshen.org/). Prior to this, I was a visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Prof. Yueqi Chen](http://cusecurity.cs.colorado.edu/yueqichen/). I also worked closely with [Prof. Mingxue Zhang](https://zhangmx1997.github.io/) at Zhejiang University. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Jiangxi Normal University at 2022.  

Back in college, I was a devoted CTF enthusiast. I founded our university’s first CTF club [JXNUSEC](https://www.jxnusec.cn/) and was the primary solver for reverse-engineering challenges. I loved picking apart closed-source binaries in a debugger and figuring out how they worked. For a while I was fascinated by mobile-game cracking and even entered Tencent’s Game Security Competition 2022, where I solved every problem in both the [preliminary](https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-272518.htm) and [final](https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-272519.htm) rounds. Those contests also honed my self-learning skills—especially my “Google-fu.” After graduating, I entered CTF events far less frequently, and my technical focus gradually shifted toward vulnerability finding and exploit development :). 

My current research focuses on system/software security. I am interested in the security of AI system/software (GPU stack, Mlsys, etc) and apply AI techniques in security scenario (LLM for sec). I also like exploring new things like web3.


I still love hacking. I have founded many bugs and received 60 CVEs from many famous vendors (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc). My personal thought: Understand target-> Hack it😄
